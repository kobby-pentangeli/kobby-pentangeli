## Hi, I'm Kobby 👋 👩🏾‍💻 <img src="./wave.gif" width="30px">

I began flirting with **C/C++** back in 2011 when I was a sophomore in college.

In September of 2015, I founded **Komaat Engineering LLC**, to provide enterprise software solutions to companies, and to install medical equipment such as MRI, CT, X-Ray, etc for hospitals in Ghana and Nigeria.

In December of 2016, I heard about **Rust**... I learned the language, folded Komaat, and began my career as a full-time Rust Engineer.

By mid 2017, I had begun using Rust professionally, helping two clients build consortium blockchains from scratch (entirely in Rust). I spent 3 months on each project, contributing mainly to the p2p libraries, consensus protocols, and cryptographic primitives (private keys, public keys, signatures, hashes).

**...**

In recent months, I've been writing smart contracts in Rust for NEAR, Solana, and Cosmos blockchains. Other interesting projects I've worked on include:

- a blockchain-agnostic, language-agnostic Web3 SDK
- NFT-powered social media built on Solana
- launch-pools/staking protocols on Ethereum
- Merkle tree accumulator

My tech stack looks like this:

- Rust
- TypeScript
- WebAssembly
- GraphQL
- Docker
- Mustache
- Go
- C/C++ (haven't used it in a while)
